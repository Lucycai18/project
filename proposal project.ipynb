    "Grouped Bar Chart. The grouped bar chart displays the \"True\" and \"False\" groups of each confidence level side by side. This chart can help me directly compare the proportion of \"True\" and \"False\" responses in each confidence level, which is convenient to observe whether there is a significant difference in the proportion of \"True\" or \"False\" as self-confidence changes.\n",

    "-Analyses：I will use the data from 2022 cross survey， calculating the difference in the proportion of \"True\" responses across the different confidence levels.And then，under the null hypothesis of no association, randomly shuffle the calmness labels (True/False) to create multiple permutation samples. For each permutation sample, calculate the test statistic, building a distribution of these values. Finally，compare the original test statistic to the permutation distribution to compute the p-value. \n",

First, the original group statistic (e.g., mean difference) is calculated, then the emotional exhaustion labels are shuffled multiple times to create a distribution of statistics under the null hypothesis. Finally, the observed statistic is compared to this distribution to calculate a p-value.
